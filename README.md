# p5.tiledplay.js
A small library to bridge the functionality of p5.js, p5.play.js and p5.tiled.js to easily create 2D platformer games using javascript. 

What the tutorial video series at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUssYbXQRjFhxKRGtZLRxggqoExzAITci to see how to use it.

Eventually I will write better documentation.
